Libft is our first Project in the Core Curriculum, we have to recreate a set of functions. 

Since the most Projects in the 42 Curriculum only allow us to use only spezial , having this Libary for ourselves saves a lot of time later on.
We are also able to adjust functions for our need in specific cases.

All in all it was a good way to get started and ive enjoyed it alot!
