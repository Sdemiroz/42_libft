Libft is our first project in the Core Curriculum. We have to recreate a set of functions.

Since most projects in the 42 Curriculum only allow us to use specific functions that we are not able to recreate ourselves, having this library saves a lot of time later on. We are also able to adjust functions for our needs in specific cases.

All in all, it was a good way to get started.
